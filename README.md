# EchoChat-An_AI_ChatBot
This project, developed as part of the GTech Mulearn Pathway AI BootCamp, is an interactive chatbot powered by Langchain and OpenAI modules. It intelligently understands and generates natural language responses, providing users with a seamless and user-friendly conversational experience.

## Overview

The LLM Chatbot is designed to intelligently understand and generate natural language responses, providing users with an enhanced conversational interface. This project was created as a practical application during the Pathway AI BootCamp conducted by GTech Mulearn. Here I'm using Python 3.9 version.

## Features

- **Language Model Integration:** Utilizes Langchain for a robust and versatile language model.
- **OpenAI Modules:** Enhances natural language understanding and generation capabilities.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for intuitive interaction. The interface is created using streamlit module in python.

## Technologies Used

- Langchain
- OpenAI
- streamlit
